\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{XChromatograms} or \code{MChromatograms} object with detected
chromatographic peaks.}

\item{param}{A \code{PeakDensityParam} object defining the peak density correspondence
parameters. If missing, the function will try to extract it from the object's
process history (if correspondence has been performed).}

\item{col}{Color for the chromatogram lines in the upper panel (default: "#00000060").}

\item{xlab}{X-axis label (default: "retention time").}

\item{main}{Plot title (default: NULL).}

\item{peakType}{Type of peak annotation in upper panel: "polygon", "point",
"rectangle", or "none" (default: "polygon").}

\item{peakCol}{Color for peak markers (default: "#00000060").}

\item{peakBg}{Background color for peak markers (default: "#00000020").}

\item{peakPch}{Point character for peak markers when peakType = "point" (default: 1).}

\item{simulate}{Logical, whether to simulate correspondence analysis (TRUE) or
display existing results (FALSE). Default: TRUE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plot methods.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object with two panels:
\itemize{
\item Upper panel: Chromatogram(s) with identified peaks
\item Lower panel: Peak density along retention time axis showing individual
peaks as points (y-axis = sample) with density estimate overlaid as
a line. Grey rectangles indicate peaks grouped into features.
}
}
\description{
Visualizes the density of chromatographic peaks along the retention time axis
to help evaluate peak density correspondence analysis settings. This is a ggplot2
implementation of XCMS's \code{plotChromPeakDensity()} function.
}
\details{
The function creates a two-panel visualization:
\itemize{
\item Upper panel shows the chromatographic data with detected peaks
\item Lower panel shows each peak at its retention time (x-axis) and sample (y-axis)
\item A kernel density estimate is shown as a line
\item Grey rectangles indicate peaks that would be (simulate=TRUE) or have been
(simulate=FALSE) grouped into features based on the peak density method
}

This visualization is particularly useful for optimizing \code{PeakDensityParam}
settings, especially the \code{bw} (bandwidth) parameter which controls the smoothing
of the density estimate.

\strong{Note:} Currently only supports plotting a single row (m/z slice) across multiple
samples. If \code{object} has multiple rows, please subset to one row first.
