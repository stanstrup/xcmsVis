Your purpose is to make an R package, xcmsVis, that should be a parallel package to the XCMS package.
The goal is to implement all the plots in xcms as ggplot2 plots so they can be made interactive. Some discussion and motivation can be found here: https://github.com/sneumann/xcms/issues/551

Make a plan to accomplish the following:

1) make the folder a git repo
2) familiarize yourself with the xcms code base: https://github.com/sneumann/xcms
3) follow XCMS package conventions as closely as possible paying attention the the methods and object types.
4) create the package structure including a pkgdown page taking inspiration from /mnt/c/Users/tmh331/Desktop/gits/remoteUpdater
5) implement gplotAdjustedRtime found here: /mnt/c/Users/tmh331/Desktop/gits/_Introduction to Nutritional Metabolomics/inm-booklet/scripts/funs.R
6) make a vignette comparing gplotAdjustedRtime to xcms's gplotAdjustedRtime with an example. Use datasets used in the tutorials from here: https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/Metabonaut. This vignette should be ready to add more comparisons to.
8) when you have accomplished a point from this file move the instruction to a file listing accomplished tasks.
9) Update your instructions
10) use main as the default branch
11) this needs to run on github actions instead of gitlab CI.
12) use an xcmsExperiment objects as the input for examples and make sure the functions worg with xcmsExperiment objects.
13) generate the pkgdown page
