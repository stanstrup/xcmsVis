# Current Tasks

**See `CLAUDE.md` for development workflow, conventions, and resources.**

Read the XCMS source code and try to implement ggplot2 versions of the following plots:
* plotChromPeaks ✅ COMPLETED
* plotChromPeakImage ✅ COMPLETED
* highlightChromPeaks ✅ COMPLETED

Included should be tests and a vignette (I think these 3 can live together).
* Tests ✅ COMPLETED (31 tests, all passing)
* Vignette - IN PROGRESS
