# Current Tasks

**See `CLAUDE.md` for development workflow, conventions, and resources.**

## Completed Tasks

* ✅ Windows build investigation - documented as upstream bug (RStudio/r-lib/actions issue)
* ✅ Fixed gplot() default peakType to "polygon" to match original XCMS
* ✅ Refactored ghighlightChromPeaks() to accept XChromatogram objects directly
* ✅ Updated vignettes to use gplot() instead of manual ggplot() calls
* ✅ Added side-by-side comparison with original highlightChromPeaks()
* ✅ Removed excessive justification language from vignettes
* ✅ Added badges to README

## Next Steps

* when I have confirmed that all works then next is implementing all other plots. Follow the same recipe. If you need to also get plots from Msnbase then do so.
