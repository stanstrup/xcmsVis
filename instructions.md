# Current Tasks

**See `CLAUDE.md` for development workflow, conventions, and resources.**

* use loadXcmsData throughout tests, examples and vignettes to get XCMSnExp or XcmsExperiment instead of creating manually. Much faster. xdata and xmse objects already have alignment/correspondence data. faahko_sub and faahko_sub2 only have peaks picked.
* since we are reusing so much code from XCMS you should add all contributors from XCMS to this package.
