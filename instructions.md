Great. all seems to work now.
Next I want you to make a ggplot2 version of "plot" for XcmsExperiments and XCMSnExp. Study the original XCMS code and replicate as much as possible Call XCMS internal functions if possible.
Example usage at https://jorainer.github.io/xcmsTutorials/articles/xcms-preprocessing.html in the sections: "Visualize the full MS data for a small m/z - rt area" and "Smooth and centroid the spectra data".
